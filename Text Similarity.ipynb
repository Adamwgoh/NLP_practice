    "## Text Similarity using Jaccard Similarity\n",
    "You can use Jaccard Similarity instead of using Cosine Similarity. It's also nice and common way to compute the similarity between two objects, such as two text documents. To explain the area of Jaccard similarity that can be used to find the similarity between two asymmetric binary vectors or to find the similarity between two sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to calculate similarity using Jaccard similarity, you need to first perform lemmatization to reduce words to the same root word. Such as \"friendly\" -> \"friend\", \"has\" or \"have\" -> \"has\" in both text and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some differences between these two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Jaccard similarity takes only unique set of words for each sentence / document while cosine similarity takes total length of the vectors. (these vectors could be made from bag of words term frequency or tf-idf)\n",
    "* This means that if you repeat the word “friend” in Sentence 1 several times, cosine similarity changes but Jaccard similarity does not. For ex, if the word “friend” is repeated in the first sentence 50 times, cosine similarity drops to 0.4 but Jaccard similarity remains at 0.5.\n",
    "* Jaccard similarity is good for cases where duplication does not matter, cosine similarity is good for cases where duplication matters while analyzing text similarity. For two product descriptions, it will be better to use Jaccard similarity as repetition of a word does not reduce their similarity.\n",

    "Task: \"Compare two documents through text similarity and Jaccard Similarity\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Baseline: Preprocess with the same pipeline of the same document. then, generate its cosine and jaccard similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment 1 : Alter the preprocess pipeline and run for both. See which one will drop in its calue."
